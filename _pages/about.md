I am currently a second-year graduate student in Software Engineering at East China Normal University. My supervisor is Professor Jianwen Li. I received my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from East China Normal University in 2023.

My research interests are mainly Efficient ML, LLM, Agent, AI Compile. I am very interested in how to improve the training and inference speed of large language models, including but not limited to optimizing operators and training and inference frameworks.

From May 2024 to March 2025, I interned in the Base Model Group of Sensetime Research Institute. I worked on the reasoning acceleration of large models and data synthesis of base models. 

Now I am working in the Alibaba Cloud Compiler Group on LLM reasoning framework optimization and AI compilation-related work.
